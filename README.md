[This mod would've been 100 times more difficult to make without Chomp's templates or without the help from experienced mod creators in the Discord].

This mod normalizes each caliber's velocity. The goal was to have similar bullet drop/grouping for different types of ammo [i.e. US gs and PS gs for 5.56x45mm]

 Drag and drop the "user" folder into your SPT directory.
 Load order shouldn't matter unless you have other mods that affect ammo velocity.
